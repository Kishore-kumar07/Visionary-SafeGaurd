# Visionary SafeGuard

## Overview
Visionary SafeGuard is an advanced web application designed to revolutionize car safety. By integrating artificial intelligence and computer vision, this system provides exceptional protection through facial authentication and drowsiness detection features.

## Features
- **Facial Authentication:** Enhance security by ensuring that only authorized individuals can start and operate the vehicle.
- **Drowsiness Detection:** Monitors driver alertness to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Pytorch, TensorFlow
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Pytorch
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visionary-safeguard.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd visionary-safeguard
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the Django development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the application.

## How It Works
### Facial Authentication
The system captures and analyzes facial features using computer vision techniques to authenticate the driver. Only recognized faces are allowed to start the vehicle.

### Drowsiness Detection
Using real-time video analysis, the system monitors the driver's eyes and head movements to detect signs of drowsiness. Alerts are generated to wake up the driver if drowsiness is detected.
